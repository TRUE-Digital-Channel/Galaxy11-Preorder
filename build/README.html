<p>Landing page for Samsung Galaxy S11 Pre Booking</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>This is the code respository for the Samsung Galaxy S11 Pre Booking Landing Page. It is being designed with static HTML resources, CSS and JS. Project is using CodeKit application to build and compile the code based on the Foundation Responsive Design Framework.</p>

<p>Please run <code>npm install</code> to download and install the necessary build node package dependencies. CodeKit is setup to push the completed static web files into the <code>/build/</code> folder.</p>

<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>

<p>To deploy to server, please copy across the contents of only the <code>/build/</code> folder. Can exclude the <code>scss</code> and <code>yarn.lock</code> folder from deployment assets as well.</p>

<h3 id="bundlingthejsfiles">Bundling the JS files</h3>

<p>All the library JS files link directly to <code>node_modules</code> directory from the HTML pages. To make deployment package lightweight (and less complex), please copy across the minified JS files from the <code>node_modules</code> locations and put them directly into <code>/build/js/</code> and then make sure you update the HTML to point to these JS files.</p>

<h4 id="todo">TODO</h4>

<p>Bundling the JS files manually is not ideal approach to packaging the code. Will be working on a way change reference of JS files from <code>node_modules</code> to having their own JS folder and compiling straight from there into the build folder. Want to make it easier to distribute code.</p>

<h3 id="checkoutprocess">Checkout process</h3>

<p>Currently the &#8220;Call to Action&#8221; buttons are linked to a demo checkout process, based on a previous campaign for iPhone 11. These pages are for mockup purposes only. They will need to be created on the server location booking.truecorp.co.th with updated content from TRUE/Samsung. Please disregard the contents of this folder for live deployment - THEY ARE FOR DEMO ONLY!</p>

<h3 id="googletagmanager">Google Tag Manager</h3>

<p>The GTM container code is currently commented out in the HTML. When deploying to server, ensure that GTM scripts are activated.</p>
